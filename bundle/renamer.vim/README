Basic Usage:
Show a list of file names in a directory, rename then in the vim 
buffer using vim editing commands, then have vim rename them on disk
Start the plugin with the command :Renamer

Details:
Renaming a single file is easily done via an operating system file explorer,
the vim file explorer (netrw.vim), or the command line.  When you want to
rename a bunch of files, especially when you want to do a common text
manipulation to those file names, this plugin may help.  It shows you all
the files in the current directory, and lets you edit their names in the vim
buffer.  When you're ready, issue the command ":Ren" to perform the mass
rename.  The intention is to rename files in the same directory, but
relative paths can be specified to move files around - provided the 
destination directories exist
